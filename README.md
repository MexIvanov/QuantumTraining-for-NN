# QuantumTraining-for-NN
Quantum circuit for training a simple example of a neural network with two input neurons. The training is performed based on the principles of Grover's algorithm.

Described in paper "Development of Quantum Circuits for Perceptron Neural Network Training, Based on the Principles of Grover's Algorithm": https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09891

The circuit was built in "Quirk" quantum simulator, which was made by Craig Gidney https://algassert.com/
